#Overview

**xWeb** is a simple responsive HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework fast, easy to use and fully-featured.

It has been written by @_Flavius12 at EvolSoft using [Less.js](http://lesscss.org/) CSS pre-processor.

By default xWeb uses [Font-Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy and it has been compiled on Windows using the fantastic [WinLess](http://winless.org/) compiler :)
